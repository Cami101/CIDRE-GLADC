# CIDRE-GLADC
anomalous citation detection research

Abstract
This paper explores advanced machine-learning techniques applied to citation networks to detect anomalous citation behaviors. Utilizing a dataset comprising a snapshot of the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) from 2013, we implement two algorithms, CIDRE and GLADC, to address the challenges posed by citation manipulation. CIDRE focuses on identifying anomalous groups by computing donor and recipient scores, while GLADC leverages contrastive learning to discern irregularities in graph-level structures. Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of these models in detecting anomalous activities within academic citations, with CIDRE achieving a recall of 0.68 and GLADC achieving a recall of 0.74.
